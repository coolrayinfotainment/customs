## Frequently installed apps

- Autokit for Carplay [Download](https://tbox.carlinkit.cn/autokit_2022.apk)
- Waze/Maps (gps dongle setup needed)
- Spotify
- Netflix
- Launcher
- Wifi

Just search any compatible apks. (I heard you can find some from apkpure or apkmirror üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è)

Android 4.3 compatible apps are limited and note that not all are compatible with our unit. 

I would suggest to keep the app install to the bare minimum. Our unit is equivalent to a midrange phone around 2012.

**Do not install Google Playstore or any google services. **

### How to uninstall
1. Open ES File Manager
2. From the side menu go to Apps.
3. Select app to uninstall.

## How to remove ES and all 3rd party apps
1. Go to settings and reset factory settings.

## Notes
- The script will not reflash your headunit, it will just install the ES File Manager, so that you could install apps easier.
- This can be easily reverted by `resetting to factory settings` from the settings.
- This will not root your device, unless you install kingroot.

## Tested
- 2022 Coolray SE Sports | H50.00032

## Support
Nope, I won't give support personally as I hope this is already a noob friendly guide.

I'm hoping this will spark a free 'modding' community for our headunit.

Let's utilize the issues tabs so that we could improve this document and pseudo support.

Pull request are welcome!

## Will this void my headunit warranty?
Let's assume the worse, yes! But if you are paranoid, you could just reset to factory default before going to any dealership.

## Disclaimer
The script is from a [Russian forum](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1001500&st=600#entry107246765) made for their Coolray but compatible to PH Coolrays. Kudos to them.
I will not be liable for any damages that will happen to your device when you install system breaking apps.
